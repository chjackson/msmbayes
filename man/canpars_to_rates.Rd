\title{Convert between canonical parameters and rates for a phase-type distribution}
\usage{
canpars_to_rates(pars, type = "vector")

rates_to_canpars(rates, type = "vector")
}
\arguments{
\item{pars}{Canonical parameters, supplied in the order:
\itemize{
\item sojourn rate in phase 1
\item additive increments in sojourn rates for each successive phase
\item probabilities (not rates) of absorption from each phase, for phase 1 up to the second last.
}

or a list with three components, one vector for each of these
three parameter types.}

\item{type}{\code{"vector"} or \code{"list"}.}

\item{rates}{List with two components for progression and
absorption rates, in increasing order of phase, or a vector with
these concatenated.}
}
\value{
A list with components

\code{p} progression rates between phases

\code{a} absorption rates

or a vector with these components concatenated, depending on the \code{"type"} argument.
