\description{
Effects of covariates on competing exit transitions in phase type
models
}
\details{
Only applicable to phase-type approximation models,
specified with \code{pastates}.

\code{logrra} gives the Linear effect of covariates on log relative
risk of transition to a competing destination state, relative to
baseline destination state.

\code{rra} gives the exponential of the linear effect,
interpretable as a hazard ratio.  See the semi-Markov models
vignette and paper for the mathematical details.
