\title{Summarise intermittenly-observed multi-state data}
\usage{
statetable(
  data,
  state = "state",
  subject = "subject",
  time = "time",
  time_groups = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame giving the observed data.}

\item{state}{Character string naming the observed state variable in
the data.  This variable must either be an integer in 1,2,...,K,
where K is the number of states, or a factor with these integers
as level labels.  If omitted, this is assumed to be \code{"state"}.}

\item{subject}{Character string naming the individual ID variable in the data.
If omitted, this is assumed to be \code{"subject"}.}

\item{time}{Character string naming the observation time variable in the data.
If omitted, this is assumed to be \code{"time"}.}

\item{time_groups}{Number of groups to summarise the time
intervals by.  The transitions are categorised into groups
according to equally-spaced quantiles of the time interval
length.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns \code{fromstate}, \code{tostate}, \code{timelag} and
\code{n} (count of transitions)
}
\description{
Tabulate observed transitions between states over successive observations, by
from-state, to-state and (optionally) time interval length.
}
\details{
This is like the function \code{statetable.msm} in \pkg{msm}, except that it
uses msmbayes syntax for specifying the data, it also summarises
the length of the time intervals between successive observations,
and returns a tidy data frame.

\strong{Warning}: it is not appropriate to choose the transition structure
(the \code{Q} argument to \code{msmbayes()}) on the basis of this summary.
\code{statetable} counts transitions over a \emph{time interval}, whereas
\code{Q} indicates which \emph{instantaneous} transitions are possible.
The structures will not be the same.  For example, in a model with
instananeous transitions from mild to moderate illness, and moderate
to severe, we might observe transitions from mild to severe over
an interval of 1 year (say), but the instantaneous transition from
mild to severe is impossible.

Note this is not fully tidy-friendly, as it will not work
if \code{data} is grouped using dplyr.
