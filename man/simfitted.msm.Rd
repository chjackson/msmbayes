\title{Simulate from a Markov model fitted using msm}
\usage{
simfitted.msm(x, drop.absorb = TRUE, drop.pci.imp = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted multi-state model object as returned by \code{\link{msm}}.}

\item{drop.absorb}{Should repeated observations in an absorbing state be
omitted.  Use the default of \code{TRUE} to avoid warnings when using the
simulated dataset for further \code{\link{msm}} fits.  Or set to
\code{FALSE} if exactly the same number of observations as the original data
are needed.}

\item{drop.pci.imp}{In time-inhomogeneous models fitted using the \code{pci}
option to \code{\link{msm}}, censored observations are inserted into the
data by \code{\link{msm}} at the times where the intensity changes, but
dropped by default when simulating from the fitted model using this
function. Set this argument to \code{FALSE} to keep these observations and
the corresponding indicator variable.}
}
\value{
A dataset with variables as described in \code{\link{simmulti.msm}}.
}
\description{
Simulate a dataset from a Markov model fitted using \code{\link{msm}}, using
the maximum likelihood estimates as parameters, and the same observation
times as in the original data.
}
\details{
This function is a wrapper around \code{\link{simmulti.msm}}, and only
simulates panel-observed data.  To generate datasets with the exact times of
transition, use the lower-level \code{\link{sim.msm}}.

Markov models with misclassified states fitted through the \code{ematrix}
option to \code{\link{msm}} are supported, but not general hidden Markov
models with \code{hmodel}.  For misclassification models, this function
includes misclassification in the simulated states.

This function is used for parametric bootstrapping to estimate the null
distribution of the test statistic in \code{\link{pearson.msm}}.
